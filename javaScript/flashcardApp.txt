	flashcard App:

I could and should definitely develop this app with javaScript, at least for the front-end side of things. In regards to the backend/database side of things, I can definitely do the backend with Java. 
	- Of course there is the option to develop the back-end with Javascript which would defintiely be interesting to do. I should keep this in mind while also trying to figure out how the process works with Java. Learning Java is definitely a useful skill and I should learn how to do it either way.

Anyway, I should outline the steps I want to create in order to develop this flashcard App:

1. I need to develop the UI end of things. It will be basic at first but I was initially thinking of an App similar to what Quizlet does. 
2. I need to develop an input/output type of deal where the user can input the necessary data. 
	a. There will be two sets of data for each flashcard. Maybe a map would be good for this as I can store two values? There are quite a bit of data structures that I can utilize. (I can check out my notes for these later)
3. I need to include a way for the user to add new cards to their deck. This could be a <div>/<button> below a main <div> where all the current cards that have been created are being displayed. 
4. I also need to include a button that allows the user to finish their set once they have included all the cards they want
5. After they are finished, the cards need to be used and practiced.
	a. Include an option where the user can switch between the definition/answer
